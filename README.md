# Chemo_mechanical_modeling
Chemo mechanical modleing of Li-ion battery degradation using RKPM. 
Learning and creation of a simple, isotropic electrochemical model which captures the degradation of cathode during cycling using mesh-free RKPM.
Files in this repository include shape functions, initial conditions, echem governing equations, and I/O visualization
